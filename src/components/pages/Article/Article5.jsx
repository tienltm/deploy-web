            As soon as you decide to start spending or accepting money as a
            business, you should open a business bank account, which is an
            essential step in managing your finances. Common types of business
            accounts include a checking account, a savings account, and a
            merchant account, the latter of which allows you to accept debit and
            credit card payments from customers.

            Business savings accounts are ideal if you want to save for major
            purchases like equipment, create an emergency fund for unexpected
            events, or earn interest. Many banks typically offer competitive
            interest rates on high-yield savings accounts with little to no
            monthly fee depending on your account balance. Minimum requirements
            for opening deposit amounts may vary.{' '}
