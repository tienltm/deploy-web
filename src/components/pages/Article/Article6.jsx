          <h1>Definition and Examples of a Profit and Loss Statement</h1>
          <p>
            A PnL statement, also known as an “income statement,” is a financial
            statement that details income and expenses over a specific period.
            This report helps you understand what's behind a company's
            profitability by categorizing revenues and expenses. For example,
            you can see if a business spends more than it earns on production,
            and you can view operating profits separately from financing costs
            and taxes.
          </p>

          <h1>Analyzing Profit and Loss Statements Over Time</h1>
          <p>
            A PnL statement provides valuable information about income and
            expenses. But for a complete view of an organization's financial
            health, it’s wise to review other financial statements, as well.
